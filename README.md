# COVID TEST CHECKER
Did you get tested for COVID-19 at Berlin Central Station or Berlin ZOB and you're tired of checking their and the hilarious pdf?
I totally feel with you, as I had to wait forever to get my test results. Yawn!
In order to avoid wasting my time, I developed a basic script to check for your test results ... happy waiting!

__Instructions:__
- Make sure you have Python installed 
- Open a command line of your choice
- run `pip install pdfplumber`
- run `python test_check.py --id [insert your id]`
- If you want to check for another date than today, add --date YYYYMMDD, e.g. --date 20200820
- Cheers!
